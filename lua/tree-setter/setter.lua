-- What does it do?
--	This function adds the given character to the end of the line.
--
-- Parameters:
--	@bufnr: The buffer number where to change it (0 for current)
--	@line_num: The line number where the character should be added to
--	@character: The character which should be added to the line (if it's not
--	there yet)

	-- will move the indentation of the current line as well. This
	-- variable stores the indent of the previous line which will be
	-- added after adding the given line with the semicolon/comma/double
	-- point.
